# Coronavirus Analytics

This project looks at infection, death and vaccination rates for Covid-19 across the world, using data from Our World in Data.

### Project aims

1. Exploratory data analysis in SQL of data imported into MS SQL Server database -- using aggregates, partitions, views and common table expressions
2. Connecting database to Tableau for visualisations -- using custom SQL queries

### Progress and next steps

Working Tableau dashboard can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid-19InfectionsandDeaths_16573831880360/Dashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). 

To focus on forming more specific questions to be answered by the dashboard, especially with regards to the status of Covid-19 infections and deaths in Asian countries, the relationship between vaccinations and infections/death rates, and potential shifts in infections/death rates of various coronavirus strains.

Future: look for data on the state/province level of each country.
