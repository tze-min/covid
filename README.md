# Coronavirus Analytics
Analysing Coronavirus infection and vaccination rates

A project that looks at infection, death and vaccination rates for Covid-19 across the world. The dataset came from Our World in Data. 

My aim for this was to get more practice with writing SQL queries in MS SQL Server on data imported from csv, as well as with connecting the database to Tableau for visualisations.
